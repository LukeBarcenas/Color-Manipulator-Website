# The Color Manipulator
This is a website that allows the user to tweak colors and discover the connections between colors. It features two main pages, a color picker that customizes accents of the website, and an interactive game that tests the user's knowledge of color similarity.

# Main Page
The main page features a color picker that allows users to customize the color of a square in the center of the screen. The chosen color generates five channel-swapped variations, representing the main square's RGB values in different orders. Additionally, the main page displays data about the created color, including the respective percentages of red, green, and blue, the hex value, and other base conversions of the color's value.

The page also includes some hidden features that users might not notice on their first visit. Certain color combinations (e.g., 100% red, green, or blue) trigger text displaying the color's name. This feature extends to other colors, particularly those with evenly split RGB values.

# Color Hex Value Game
The "Game" page on the website offers an interactive minigame that tests users' knowledge of color comparison. The game begins by asking the user for their name, which generates a unique color. The user is then shown three new colors and must choose which of the three is closest to their generated color. Each correct guess earns the user a point. If the user guesses incorrectly, the correct answer is revealed, and the user can either return to the name selection or restart the game.
